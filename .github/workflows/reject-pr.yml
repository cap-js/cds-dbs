            ❗️Until cds9 is released, we need to ensure code integrity by local testing.  

            Please follow these steps to run your changes against all tests in our pipeline:
            1. Go to [our matrix tests](https://github.tools.sap/cap/.github/actions/workflows/matrix.yml).
            2. Click **“Run workflow”**.
            3. For **“specific branches for the cds packages”** insert `cds-dbs:${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}` and execute the workflow.  

            Once the matrix tests are **green**, confirm it here.  
            An admin will then merge your PR. 😊

      # 2. Fail the workflow on purpose so the PR stays blocked
      - name: Fail immediately
        run: |
          echo "Failing intentionally until cds9 release."
          exit 1
