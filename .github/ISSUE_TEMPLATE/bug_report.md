<!-- Please support your supporters: Avoid screen shots and use markdown as much as possible

Avoid code screen shots from your IDE where ever possible, instead use [code markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) and syntax highlighting: `cds`, `sql`, `diff`.

- Bitmap images are hard to read due to different color schemes and screen resolutions.
  Usually they need to be opened in a different browser tab, enlarged etc.
  Especially when working on multiple issues in parallel, it's easy to loose sight.
- Code/Messages can't be copied/pasted into own editors, test files etc.

```js
 await SELECT.one.from(req.target).columns('max(ID) as ID')
```

> When deploying to sqlite we get the following errors:
