The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Primarily a bildungsroman, Jane Eyre follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall. The novel revolutionised prose fiction in that the focus on Jane's moral and spiritual development is told through an intimate, first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. The book contains elements of social criticism, with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core and is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism.","author_id":107,"genre_id":11,"stock":11,"price":"12.34","currency_code":"GBP","image":null},{"createdat":"1999-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","createdby":"anonymous","modifiedat":"1999-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","modifiedby":"anonymous","id":251,"title":"The Raven","descr":"\\"The Raven\\" is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe.
