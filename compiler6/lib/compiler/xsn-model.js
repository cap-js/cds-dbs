// Base classes used as prototypes for XSN definitions, elements, etc.
// The goal is to have named classes that can be seen in performance analyses, e.g.
// by using the [DeOpt Explorer][1].
// All classes should also be constructible using `{ __proto__: Class, â€¦}`, i.e.
// their constructors must not do anything besides assigning properties.
//
// Refer to these resources:
// - <https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics>
// - <https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties>
//
// Before adding new properties, evaluate whether it has any performance
// impact.  Too many properties that are rarely used could reduce performance,
// but too few could lead to inconsistent object shapes for commonly
// used properties.
//
// Use [DeOpt Explorer][1] to see the different object Maps by v8.
